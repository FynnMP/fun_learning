# LEARNxCASINO - Learn Hard, Play Hard!

Welcome to our innovative Learning platform. With this program you can study fundamental concepts of the St. Galler Management Modell as well as basic accounting principles. Your hardly earned money can be used to buy watches, cars, boats and art in the shop. If you are a rather risk loving person you can try multiplying your money in our casino. DonÂ´t forget to check out your treasures in the showroom. Have fun and best of luck!

**Learning with SGMM or accounting memory:**

**Casino (Roulette and Slot machine):**

Once you have bought items you do not have to worry about losing them once you close the menu. Your earned money as well as any bought items is saved and will be availble for you to use once you decide to continue learning with our project. 

# How to run


# Debug
If you have any problem running the project please make sure that you have all the necessary packages libraries installed. Namely those are: 
1. tkinter
2. pygame
3. subprocess 
4. sys
5. json
6. random
7. os
8. ctypes

Apart from pygame and tkinter the libraries should be already installed by default with the latest version of python. To install the needed libraries use the terminal and the "pip install {packagename}" command. 
Also do not manually change the data structure of the json files. Otherwise the interprogram money and inventory logic might break down. To have earned money and bought items available after closing the menu, make sure that you do not clone or download the whole project again, since your progress is only saved locally.  

# Ideation
We embarked on a mission to make learning more engaging and digitally immersive by combining it with the excitement of casino games. As four students we have experienced the exhaustion of studying for countless exams and thus thought about a solution. Our project aims to revolutionize education by providing a platform where learning and fun seamlessly intertwine.
